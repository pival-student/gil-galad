# How to use

Copy this directory somewhere and open 'filter.html' with a browser.

Import the data to filter via 'Load items' button. Data should be one item per line, with optional example text after a tab, e.g.

item1

item2 \tab example2

item3..

To discard an item press the 'Kick' button or 'A' key, to keep it use the 'D' key or 'Keep' button.
You will see the item counts adjust in the top bar and the next item will be loaded.

Pressing the 'Download' button will download three files, for remaining, excluded and kept items.
